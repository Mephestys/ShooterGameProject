# ShooterGameProject
A simple twin-stick shooter, going for an Alien Breed type of gameplay and atmosphere, with some nice lighting and field-of-sight effects.

Requires Godot v3.1.0-stable or higher.

## Controls
Best played with a controller, as this is a twin-stick shooter. Mouse+keyboard controls should be implemented sometime as well.

* Move - Right analog stick
* Aim - Left analog stick
* Fire - Right trigger

## Features
* Top-down line-of-sight system (using shadowmaps).
* Colored level lighting
* More info to come

## Major changes in this branch:
* No more debug console available, it didn't play nice with converting to Godot 3.1 so I've dropped it for now.
