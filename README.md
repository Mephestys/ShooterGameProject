# ShooterGameProject
A simple twin-stick shooter, going for an Alien Breed type of gameplay and atmosphere, with some nice lighting and line-of-sight effects.

Requires Godot v3.1.0-stable or higher.

**If you're using Godot 3.1, check out the [3.1 testing branch](https://github.com/daniel-abbott/ShooterGameProject/tree/3.1-testing).**

## Controls
Best played with a controller, as this is a twin-stick shooter. Mouse+keyboard controls are also available.

* Move - Right analog stick or keyboard WASD
* Aim - Left analog stick or right mouse button
* Fire - Right trigger or left mouse button
* Pickup Item - Controller A button or keyboard E
* Scroll Items - Directional pad up/down or mousewheel up/down

Controls are set up in a way that will allow them to be customizable in the future.

## Features
* Top-down line-of-sight system (using shadowmaps).
* Colored level lighting
* More info to come

## Major changes in this branch:
* No more debug console available, it didn't play nice with converting to Godot 3.1 so I've dropped it for now.
