# ShooterGameProject
A simple twin-stick shooter, going for an Alien Breed type of gameplay and atmosphere, with some nice lighting and field-of-sight effects.

Requires Godot v3.0.4-stable or higher (3.0.6-stable recommended).

**If you're using Godot 3.1, check out the [3.1 testing branch](https://github.com/daniel-abbott/ShooterGameProject/tree/3.1-testing).**

## Controls
Best played with a controller, as this is a twin-stick shooter. Mouse+keyboard controls should be implemented sometime as well.

* Move - Right analog stick
* Aim - Left analog stick
* Fire - Right trigger
* Debug Console - `~` key (currently doesn't offer much)

## Features
* Top-down line-of-sight system (using shadowmaps).
* Colored level lighting
* More info to come
